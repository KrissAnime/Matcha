        "Bio": "Esdeath was a sadist who lacked empathy for people of whom she deemed weak, since she lives by her father's philosophy ('The strong survive and the weak die'). She enjoyed putting her enemies through great pain, both physically and emotionally. She had no qualms about killing innocent people to get what she wanted, and rationalized her behavior with her father's old creed. Esdeath was known to treat her subordinates well, letting them do as they please, which in turn inspired their intense loyalty and devotion; this makes her followers the strongest offensive force of the Empire. To her credit, Esdeath has demonstrated genuine care for her subordinates - the Three Beasts and Jaegers in particular - and unhesitatingly authorized them to kill Tatsumi should he ever endanger their lives.",

She serves as a sort of big sister figure to Tatsumi and younger members in Night Raid, often referring to herself as 'onee-san'. Despite the morally dodgy nature that she sometimes displayed, Leone is not one to tolerate injustice, and can be especially vicious to those who commit the vilest of acts. She also enjoys fighting her enemies a lot, as said by Najenda who told her that she needs to change that habit.",
